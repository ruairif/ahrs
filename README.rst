Attitude and Heading Reference System
=====================================

Attitude and Heading Reference System interfacing with accelerometers,
gyroscopes and magnetometers over an I2C bus.

The Honeywell HMC5883L is supported and can be used to detect the direction of
the Earth's magnetic field relative to the device.

The Analog Devices ADXL345 accelerometer can be used to measure acceleration
along the x, y and z axes relative to gravity.

The InvenSense ITG3200 or ST Microelectronics L3G4200G gyroscopes can be used
to measure angular rotation rate.

The XBow Nav440 AHRS system for measuring yaw, pitch, roll, acceleration,
heading and angular rate

The Sony PlayStation Move controller. This games controller comes equipped with
a Kionix KXSC4 accelerometer, an STMicroelectronics LY5250ALH gyroscope for yaw
measurements and an STMicroelectronics LPR425AL gyroscope for roll and pitch
measurements as well as an AKM Semiconductor AK8974 magnetometer.

Installing
----------
To use this library the host computer needs to have support for communicating
with I2C devices. The other requirement is the python-smbus library must be
installed.

On Ubuntu/Debian::

    apt-get install i2c-tools

On Arch::

    pacman -S i2c-tools

To use the PS Move as a sensor the psmoveapi_ library need to be installed on
your system and the python bindings must be in your python path. If these conditions are satisfied then it should be possible to use the PS Move as an AHRS
sensor.
